This reposititory provides supplementary codes and data for the following work 

- Chen, Zhao, Yang Liu, and Hao Sun. "Physics-informed learning of governing equations from scarce data." arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.03448 (2020).

I forked the original repository to run tests to learn how to apply this method on other equations with other data used on my current research.
